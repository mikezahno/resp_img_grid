Field Formatter for Gallery Thumbnails
==========

Drupal 7.x Module

Displays the current window size including standard bootstrap breakpoints.

I also included a block, if you dont want to use the overlay.

This Module is a modification of https://drupal.org/project/windowsize

I posted the code in this post:
https://drupal.org/node/2153533

Happy Bootstrapping :)
